Functional mechanism blocks
==

The idea here is to create a bunch of cubical units with gears and shafts and levers
and things inside them, which can be assembled into amusing little machines. The cubes
have mounting holes so that they can be connected with nuts and bolts and lock washers.

Rotational couplers could be jaw couplings, or could be two tabs connected by a nut and
bolt. Tabs can also be used for translational coupling, or translational coupling could
be done by rod 1 pushing rod 2, and rod 2 has a restoring spring.

The thing to do is to design the first couple of blocks, with a single rotational coupling
in the centers of the connecting faces.

It would be good if the mounting holes on the cubes could accomodate long threaded rods
in order to build larger structures.
